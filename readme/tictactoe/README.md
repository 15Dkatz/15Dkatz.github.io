# Play some Tic Tac Toe!

Check it out at [http://davidtkatz.com/#/tictactoe](http://davidtkatz.com/#/tictactoe)

The game features the standard two-dimensional array (#) that we grew up playing with.

There's two modes: 'impossible' and 'easy'. The second mode comes in handy when you just want to catch a break from all the ties and losses. You can choose to either go 'second' or 'first'. Maybe it'll make a difference!

You can even choose to ditch the computer opponent and play against a friend: choose 'Player versus player' instead of the default 'Player versus computer' mode.

Also, pay attention to the game's feedback. It lets you know who should go, as well as if someone has already won!

Alright, let's see how many wins, draws, and losses you rack up! Enjoy!

**********
I was inspired to make this game by the good folks at Zendesk. I built the game using ReactJS and ES6. I ended up writing a lot of helper methods to create the computer opponent as well as to generate the game board. The most challenging yet fun aspect came in handling all the different scenarios of game play in tic-tac-toe; I came across a surprising number of possible outcomes! Needless to say, at this point, I feel like a tic-tac-pro; and I'll never look at this childhood favorite of mine in the same way again.

I had a lot of fun building this project overall, so once again, enjoy!
